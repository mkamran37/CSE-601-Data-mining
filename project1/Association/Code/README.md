# CSE-601
Principal Component Analysis and Frequent itemsets generation using Apriori algorithm and data visualization.

To generate frequent itemsets (Apriori.py),
# First install all the packages from requirements.txt
# Run the program as "python Apriori.py"
# At the input prompt, first enter the filename without the extension.
# Make sure to keep the input file in the "Data" folder
# Next, input the minimum support (default = 50%)
# For the output of each length frequent itemset, check the corresponding .txt file (e.g., "length1output.txt")

To generate rules from frequent itemsets (AssociationRuleGen.py)
# Follow the above steps by replacing Apriori.py with AssociationRuleGen.py
# Additional input: minimum confidence
# For output, check results.txt

To run tSNE.py
# Follow the above steps by replacing pca.py as TSNE.py
