# CSE-601
This project deals with the implementation and execution of 5 clustering algorithms, namely:
1. K-nearest neighbors
2. Decisiom Tree 
3. Na√Øve Bayes
4. Random Forest

# The entry point for execution of the project is the file named 'main.py'
1. First install all the packages from requirements.txt
2. Run 'main.py' and follow the instructions in the terminal to execute the algorithm of choice.
    2.1 Make sure to use the demo option when executing the demo files
    2.2 To run Naive Bayes on dataset4, enter the test data in d4test.txt

# For the competition, the entry point is competition.py
1. Execute competition.py and follow the instructions.
