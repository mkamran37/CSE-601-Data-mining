# CSE-601
This project deals with the implementation and execution of 5 clustering algorithms, namely:
1. K-nearest neighbors
2. Decisiom Tree 
3. Na√Øve Bayes
4. Random Forest

# The entry point for execution of the project is the file named 'main.py'
1. First install all the packages from requirements.txt
2. Run 'main.py' and follow the instructions in the terminal to execute the algorithm of choice.
    2.1 Make sure to use the demo option when executing the demo files
    2.2 To run Naive Bayes on dataset4, enter the test data in d4test.txt
    2.3 The decision Tree might take some time to run project3_dataset1 and project3_dataset2
    2.4 For random forest input the number of trees to generate and maximum number of features to select
    2.5 K-fold cross-validation is by default set to 10. Change the value of k manually from main.py to required value
    2.6 To run decision tree on project3_dataset4, we set kCrossValidation to 1

# For the competition, the entry point is competition.py
1. Execute competition.py and follow the instructions.
